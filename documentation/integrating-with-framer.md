# Integrating with Framer

The easiest way to integrate with [Framer](https://framer.com) is to use the [Needle Engine Framer Plugin](https://www.framer.com/marketplace/plugins/needle-engine/).   


## Add a 3D embed to your Framer project

1. Deploy your project to Needle Cloud (or use a different hosting provider)

2. In Framer click on the menu item `Insert/Plugins/Browse All` to find the Needle Engine Framer plugin
