# Networking

Access to core networking functionality can be obtained by using ``this.context.connection`` from a component. [The built-in backend server](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/needle-tiny-server) requires users to be connected to a room.

Networking is currently based on [websockets](https://github.com/jjxxs/websocket-ts) and sending either json strings (for infrequent updates) or [flatbuffers](https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/) (for frequent updates).

## Using Multiplayer

- **Enable Networking**  
  Add a `SyncedRoom` component.

- **Enable Desktop Viewer Sync**  
  Add a `SyncedCamera` component.

- **Enable XR Avatar Sync**  
  Add a `WebXRSync` component.
  
- **Enable Voice Chat**  
  Add a `VoIP` component.
  
- **Enable Screensharing**  
  Add a `ScreenCapture` component.


## Core Components

- ``SyncedRoom`` — handles networking connection and connection to a room.   
  This can also be done by code using the networking api  accessible from `this.context.connection`
- ``SyncedTransform`` — handles synchronizing transforms
- ``SyncedCamera`` — spawns a prefab for any user connected to the room which will follow their position
- ``WebXRSync`` — handles synchronization for AR and VR users
- ``VoIP`` — handles voice-over-IP audio connections, microphone access etc. between users
- ``Networking`` — use to customize the server backend url


## Manual Networking

### Sending

Send a json message to all users in the same room:   
``this.context.connection.send(key:string, data: IModel | object | boolean | string | number | null)``

Send a flatbuffer binary array to all users in the same room:   
``this.context.connect.sendBinary(arr:Uint8Array)``

#### Persistence
When sending an object containing a `guid` field it will be saved in the persistant storage and automatically sent to users that connect later or come back later to the site (e.g. to restore state).   
To delete state for a specific guid from the backend storage you can use `delete-state` as the key and provide an object with `{ guid: "guid_to_delete" } ` 

### Receiving
Subscribe to json events / listen to events in the room using a specific key  
``this.context.connection.beginListen(key:string, callback:(data) => void)``   
Unsubscribe with ``stopListening``

Subscribe to flatbuffer binary events   
``this.context.connection.beginListenBinrary(identifier:string, callback:(data : ByteBuffer) => void)``   
Unsubscribe with ``stopListenBinary``

## Auto Networking (experimental)

To automatically network fields in a component you can just decorate a field with a ``@syncField()`` decorator (note: you need to have ``experimentalDecorators: true`` in your ``tsconfig.json`` file for it to work)

:::details Example Code


<!-- SAMPLE network color change
*Automatically network a color field. The following script also changes the color randomly on click*
-->


*Simple networking of a number*
```ts
import { Behaviour, syncField } from "@needle-tools/engine"

export class AutoFieldSync extends Behaviour implements IPointerClickHandler {

    // Use `@syncField` to automatically network a field. 
    // You can optionally assign a method or method name to be called when the value changes
    @syncField("myValueChanged")
    mySyncedValue?: number = 1;
    
    private myValueChanged() {
       console.log("My value changed", this.mySyncedValue);
    }
    
    onPointerClick() {
       this.mySyncedValue = Math.random();
    }
}
```

## Networking Package

Needle Engine currently uses its [own networking package](https://fwd.needle.tools/needle-engine/packages/needle-engine-networking) hosted on npm. By default if not configured differently using the `Networking` component Needle Engine will connect to a server running on Glitch.

It can be added to your own fastiy or express server running on any server for example by adding the following code on your server after installing the package:
```js
import networking from "@needle-tools/needle-tiny-networking-ws";
networking.startServerFastify(fastifyApp, { endpoint: "/socket" });
```

The following options are available:

|  |  | 
| -- | -- |
| `endpoint` *string* | relative path to the websocket endpoint (e.g. `/socket`) |
| `maxUsers` *number* | Amount of users allowed per room |
| `defaultUserTimeout` *number* | Timeout length in seconds until a user is kicked from a room (if no ping is received). Defaults to 30 seconds |


## Networking on Glitch

When deploying your app to Glitch, we include a simple networking backend that is great for prototyping and small deployments (~15-20 people at the same time). You can later update to a bigger/better/stronger networking solution if required.  

### Limitations

- approx. 15-20 people maximum – afterwards the small default Glitch server instance becomes slow
