Unbelievable Unity editor integration by an order of magnitude,  
  and as straightforward as the docs claim. Wow.

This is huge for WebXR and shared, immersive 3D experiences! Thank you so much for putting in the work on this @NeedleTools crew! Hoping @Apple
 sort out their WebXR situation sooner rather than later. The AR part worked flawlessly on my @SamsungMobile S21.

Thanks to @NeedleTools, seeing quite a bit of this solution for web-based real time 3d tools - export scenes from Unity, where you can leverage the extensive 3d editor ecosystem & content, and then render them in your own web-based engine

 I am a long time Unity dev and recently started playing with Needle Tools and I love it! It's a great on ramp for Unity devs who want to learn WebXR and three.js. The runtime engine is awesome and it was pretty easy to create my own custom component

Spent the last 2.5 months building this game, never built a game/never used unity before, but absolutely loving the whole process with needle tools. So rapid!  Would love to make a career building AR experiences!
